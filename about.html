                    Well, its my dream career. Its what I want to do, because I know that games can be, and are pieces of art. 
                    The same as a novel, or a movie. Video games have proven to me that they can be more powerful than any movie. 
                    (I will say books rival games in their impact as imagination is stronger in my eyes, but) I have plenty of 
                    examples I can show, and as time passes the list of examples will grow all the same.

                    In this description of each game, I'll go over some of their aspects that I love about them, some assets, and what I've learned from them.

                    <p>Metal Gear Solid is a stealth action game created by Hideo Kojima, published by Konami in 1998 for the Sony Playstation. I ended up playing the game around 2004-6 when I was young, and I am happy to say
                         that MGS showed me just how united video games, and the movie going experience can be. MGS is a masterclass in story telling, game design, 
                        and art direction. Its the first game I played nonstop when I was young, and I replay it even now. I even have an original project I'm 
                        basing the deep gameplay structure on to try and recreate that tension of sneaking around with the classic 1998 feel. I learned just how 
                        immersive video games truly can be at a story level when I experienced this game.

                    <p>
                        Shadow of the Colossus was a game I sadly didn't grow up playing myself, but I saw just how impactful a games art direction can make on its execution.
                        The sole purpose of the game was to create a game with no fluff, no small side missions, no levels in between major events, only boss fights. 
                        It was developed by Team Ico at Japan Studio, after being published by Sony on the Playstation 2. The game later recieved a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_of_the_Colossus_(2018_video_game)">remake for the Playstation 4 by Bluepoint Games</a>.
                        You play as a small hero named Wander, riding a horse through a beautifully empty landscape hunting giant "Colossi". Giant stone, fur covered creatures 
                        that lumber about that land, the size of mountains. You climb them and overcome their obstacles with beautifully designed puzzles, music, and art to back it all up.
                        All the while as you battle the giant creature, this music plays:
                    </p>
                    <audio controls>
                        <source src="/audio/Shadow of the Colossus - Revived Power.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
                    </audio>
                    <p class="songtitle">
                        Revived Power - Shadow of the Colossus OST 13
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Finally, after you defeat the great creature, as you feel just how great a feat is was to do the impossible, this music helps you realize:
                    </p>
                    <audio controls>
                        <source src="/audio/Shadow of the Colossus - The End of the Battle.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
                    </audio>
                    <p class="songtitle">
                        The End of the Battle - Shadow of the Colossus OST 09
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You entered a peaceful creatures home, and unprovoked ended its life to your own end. Its not something to celebrate, and the game lets you know that in the best way it can. 
                        You killed an innocent creature, and that kind of storytelling is something I find beautiful. It is told without words, merely through visuals and music alone. 
                        Not to mention your own actions.
                    </p>
