                <p>Even since I was young, I wanted to tell stories. I'd find myself drawing comic panels, and writing elaborate story arcs 
                    then drawing them onto the notebook paper I had after school, (admittedly sometimes during.) With that thought, I initially 
                    thought the best course of action to become a movie director. But that quickly changed as soon as I played the first 
                    Metal Gear Solid game. It was a masterpiece in storytelling, gameplay, and camera work. But even more than that, it moved me. 
                    I was changed for the better by the themes, the story the game presented, and I want to do the same for people through games.

                <p>About a year and a half after I finished my Unreal Engine 4 course, 
                    Unreal Engine 5 released, and that inspired me to get back into developing with UE. 
                    To begin, I started with something I deemed simple, recreating one of my favorite childhood games. 
                    Above this description, you can watch the first devlog of the project I uploaded to YouTube on my YouTube Channel.

                <p>
                    After a good period of getting comfortable with UE5, I took a break to focus on work, and soon lost my passion to keep working as a hobby. 
                    My mentor decided as a fun project that we should attempt a Game Jam of our own between ourselves and a friend. We would try to create a horror game, 
                    suited to each others fears. I was assigned to make a game in one (or was it two?) weeks. I decided to seriously up the difficulty:
                    I wanted to learn how to make a Virtual Reality game.

                    In this game, you would watch from the cockpit of a cobbled together submarine the decent into a dark underwater trench.
                    My mentor explained he had a fear of the depths, so that was the major theme. I never finished the game properly, but I am proud 
                    of how quickly it all came together in terms of functionality, I was able to add hands, grabing at things, and I even had my sister record 
                    some diologue. It was amazing to see the writing for her lines come to life in the game. Here is a little GIF of the player looking around the submarine:
